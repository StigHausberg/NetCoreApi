# NetCoreApi
A simple MVC .netcore api with swagger and a simple NoSql [LiteDb](https://www.litedb.org/)
  

This repository was made by me as an example for [Sonat](https://sonat.no/index.php/jobbe-hos-sonat/) internal training day on openApi. 

It's implemented with oAuth2.0 but you have to create your own oAuth account for generating tokens.

If you want to work with awesome people and get great benefits contact me for a chat.

Feel free to use, no strings attached.
